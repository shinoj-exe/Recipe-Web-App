This is a project build using a free public meals API-https://www.themealdb.com/api.php . This API provides us with informations regarding certain meals and their preparation process. 
My core Aim building this project was to understand the working with APIs and also learning to use the Async await functions and JavaScript Promises. In this project it is able to add items to favourite list and also view the Ingredients and Process of making.
